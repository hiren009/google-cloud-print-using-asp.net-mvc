# google-cloud-print-using-asp.net-mvc

In this repository i have created basic working application to print using google cloud print. Base code is shamelessly copied from https://github.com/io7/GoogleCloudPrint.

In order to make this working you need to replace web.config file application keys. Please follow steps specified in https://github.com/io7/GoogleCloudPrint, in order to configure basic settings.
